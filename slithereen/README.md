SLITHEREEN - A Trivia App

This app is a multiplayer trivia game that provides players with trivia prompts which they can then answer. Every question has a different point value. There will be lots of customizable features, like the speed at which the question is read, avatars, or perhaps the ability for users to submit their own trivia questions. I plan to use React to make the frontend and Express for the backend. I'm going to use websockets to connect the users to the page.

I will probably use an API, but if I don't, here is the TriviaQuestion model.
